# Humpback Fluke Recognition using deep CNNs

This is an adaptation of the winning solution for the Right Whale Recognition kaggle challenge, repurposed to recognize humpback flukes rather than right whale heads. 

A description of the original approach is written up here: <http://deepsense.io/deep-learning-right-whale-recognition-kaggle>.

## Instructions
- These will be included once the pipeline is cemented

## Requirements
- Python libraries, as outlined in requirements.txt (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
- Nvidia GPU and cuDNN v2 (or newer)
